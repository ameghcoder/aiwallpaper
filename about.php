            <h3>Selfish Man</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 18px;">Now-a-days people become more selfish And it is right to become a selfish, Because if a man will be connected to everything around him, it is hard to leave them. So, if you want to get success in your life, you won't connect with everything around you. Only <span class="highlight-italic-text">meet them, spend time with them, and forget them.</span></p>
            <h3>What is Books ?</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 18px;">Books take away you beyond your think. Good Books are excites you to do something big in your life.</p>
            <h3>More About Books ...</h3>
            <p style="font-size : 18px">
            Everyone knows about books and also knows the main role of books in our entire life. When we are children, the books comes into our life as a giant virtual problem. Every child thinks, what the shit is this, child say to the mom, "Please save me, I don't want to study." Then Mom said that "Babu this is best for your good life and Books will help you in your entire life after me." And everyone knows that Moms never lie. Especially when she talks about your life.
            <br>
            I don't say that a book is everything in your life, But in every field to do something big you need at least a good book that make you a well behaved man and really a human. Becuase in real-world beyond science you never be a man with an only body, you always be a man with your behaviour. Now-a-days when you look around you, you find that today's environment makes that child more aggresive, because I think that only way to make you a good person is reading good books because books, only good books never make a person aggresive, only make a human being.
            </p>
            <h3>Love</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 18px;">
            Perhaps everyone has a love life in their life. Everyone knows that today's love is not real love. They only want a girl for their use in any way. Only a few people do really love her. But Now-a-days the environment and good think both are destroyed slowly. If you really want to know the meaning of real love, Filter your thoughts about girls.
